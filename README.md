# Parkinsons_Disease_Detection
A Parkinsons Disease Detection model using Random Forest Classifier.

This project is a part of my Machine Learning Course Project.
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and can have significant impacts on a person's quality of life. Common symptoms of this are stiffness and voice spasms. Voice is one of the major indicators of Parkinsons disease, and hence is the most non-inavsive and cost effective way to detect Parkinsons.

The model takes various features of the voice, such as Jitters, Shimmers, NHR, HNR etc as input and trains them using the Random Forest Classifier. After training, it can help predict the diagnosis of a new voice based on the same features. 

In this project, the Random Forest Classifier has been compared with other classifiers such as Guassian Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree and Linear Regressor.
Out of all these classifiers, Random Forest Classifier gave the best Accuracy, Precision and Recall. Hence it could be concluded that Random Forest Classifier gives the best results for the detection of Parkinsons Disease.
